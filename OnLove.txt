Love: The One Creative Force
Spread love everywhere you go: first of all in your own house. Give love to your children, to
your wife or husband, to a next door neighbour.... Let no on one ever come to you without
leaving better and happier. Be the leaving expression of God's kindness; kindness in your face,
kindness in your eyes, kindness in your smile, kindness in your warm greeting. Mother Teresa
